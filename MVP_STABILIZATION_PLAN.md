## **🔧 TECHNICAL APPROACH**

### **🏗️ MVP ARCHITECTURE**
```
Frontend: Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind
Backend: Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL
Core Features: Grants, Analytics, Auth, Database
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
Quality: ESLint + TypeScript + Prettier
```

### **📁 MVP FILE STRUCTURE**
```
src/
├── components/          # Core UI components
├── pages/              # Core pages (grants, analytics, auth)
├── lib/                # Core services
├── __tests__/          # Test files
└── mathematical-engine/ # Skeleton (completed)
```

### **🎯 MVP FEATURE SCOPE**
```
✅ IN SCOPE (MVP):
- Grant discovery and applications
- Basic analytics dashboard
- User authentication
- Core database operations
- Mathematical engine skeleton

❌ OUT OF SCOPE (Future):
- Advanced impact forecasting
- Role-based dashboards
- Task/time tracking
- Multiple integrations
- Advanced mathematical features
```
