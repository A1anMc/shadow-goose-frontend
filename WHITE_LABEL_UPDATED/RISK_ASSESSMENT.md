# ⚠️ Risk Assessment (White‑Label Deployments)

Purpose

- Identify and manage risks across technical, security, data, compliance, performance, integrations, ML, deployment, and operational domains for each client rollout.

## Scoring Matrix

- Likelihood (L/M/H) × Impact (L/M/H) → Score: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- Prefer reducing likelihood with controls; keep contingency plans for high‑impact items.

| Likelihood | Impact | Score    |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- |
| Low        | Low    | Low      |
| Low        | Medium | Medium   |
| Low        | High   | High     |
| Medium     | Low    | Medium   |
| Medium     | Medium | High     |
| Medium     | High   | Critical |
| High       | Low    | High     |
| High       | Medium | Critical |
| High       | High   | Critical |

## Category Risks & Mitigations

### Deployment & Config

- Risk: Env drift between staging and prod → Mitigation: templates + peer approvals; `configs/render.*.yaml` source‑of‑truth.
- Risk: Rollback failures → Mitigation: `MIGRATION_ROLLBACK_SOP.md`; pre‑deploy DB snapshot; feature flags.

### Security & Privacy

- Risk: Token exposure → Mitigation: Render secrets; rotate quarterly; least privilege; no secrets in logs.
- Risk: CORS misconfiguration → Mitigation: Lock `CORS_ORIGINS` to known hosts; review prior to release.
- Risk: Vulnerable deps → Mitigation: `SECURITY_SCANS.md` in CI; CVE thresholds; patch cadence.

### Data & Compliance

- Risk: PII in logs/backups → Mitigation: Scrub logs; encrypt backups; retention policy per client.
- Risk: GDPR/DSR response gaps → Mitigation: Implement export/delete endpoints; audit trails.

### Integrations

- Risk: API rate limits/quotas → Mitigation: Backoff/retry; queue; monitor vendor status.
- Risk: Schema changes upstream → Mitigation: Contract tests; versioned mappers; alert on errors.

### Performance & Scale

- Risk: p95 latency breaches → Mitigation: Redis cache; DB indexing; monitor slow queries.
- Risk: Thundering herd during reports → Mitigation: Batch/schedule; cache report results.

### ML & Analytics

- Risk: Data drift → Mitigation: Periodic eval; retraining schedule; feature stability checks.
- Risk: Misleading KPIs → Mitigation: KPI owner sign‑off; dashboard annotations; data dictionary.

### UX & Accessibility

- Risk: Branding contrast failures → Mitigation: Contrast checks; WCAG review; alt text.
- Risk: Localization bugs (i18n) → Mitigation: Pseudo‑locale testing; glossary.

### Operational

- Risk: On‑call overload → Mitigation: Escalation policies; weekly ops review; alert hygiene.
- Risk: Backup restore untested → Mitigation: Monthly restore test in staging; report.
