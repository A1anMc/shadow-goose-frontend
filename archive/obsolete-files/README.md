## Reason for Archiving
These files were created during the development and debugging phase but are no longer needed since:
1. Backend is now working correctly
2. Deployment is automated via Render
3. Live data integration is complete
4. System is production-ready

**Note:** These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used in the current system.
